while inserting we can count the if nodes exists
and if exists then how many node exists
​
```java
["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
for a -> 0
for banana -> 0
for app -> 1
for appl ->3
for ap -> 2
for apply -> 4
for apple -> 4
```
​
so at the end of insertion we get two words
```
apply, apple
```
​
so everytime we get a new max we clear the list.
